# **Learning HTML and CSS**

This is a repository where I keep HTML and CSS exercises I have done (mostly at CodeAcademy).

This repository is mainly kept for myself and is not intended to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS.

Although, feel free to explore this folder. It is mostly written in Lithuanian (names of topics and exercises).
